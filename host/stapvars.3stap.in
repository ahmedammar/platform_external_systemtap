Examples:

.TP

Contains the value of the
.BR
$#
value: the number of command line arguments passed to the systemtap script.
It is initialized with an implicit begin(-1) probe.

.TP
argv:string [long]
Contains each command line argument as a string.  argv[1] will equal @1 if
there was at least one command line argument.  Arguments beyond #32 are not
transcribed, and produce a warning message within the begin(-1) probe that
initializes this array.
