To Run:

   cd cfiles
   ./build compile
   cd ..
   ./run.sh

SCRIPTS:
   run.sh - This is the driver for automated testing.
            To run: ./run.sh stpdirectory c_binaries_directory
            Result: log/timestamp.log discerpancy report

   ctostp.sh - This script generates corresponding stp probe script
               files for every C file found in the input directory.
               To Run: ctostp.sh input output where input is the 
               directory containing the C files to convert. Output
               is the directory to store the corresponding stp
               files.

   build.sh - This script expedites the process of compiling all
              of the c files. When the "compile" flag is given
              it creates a directory called bin, which stores the
              compiled C programs. ./build.sh clean removes the
              binaries, and ./build.sh run attempts to execute all
              of the programs in cfiles/bin.
