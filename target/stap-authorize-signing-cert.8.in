.SH NAME
stap\-authorize\-signing\-cert \- systemtap signing authorization utility

.SH SYNOPSIS

.br
.B stap\-authorize\-signing\-cert \fICERTFILE\fR [ \fIDIRNAME\fR ]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fIstaprun\fR program will load modules for members of the group
\fIstapusr\fR if they are signed by a trusted signer. A trusted signer is
usually a \fIsystemtap\fR compile server which signs modules when the client
(\fIstap\-client\fR) specifies the \fB\-\-unprivileged\fR option.

.PP
The trustworthiness of a given signer can not be determined
automatically without a trusted certificate authority issuing systemtap signing
certificates. This is
not practical in everyday use and so, \fIstaprun\fR must authenticate servers
against its own database of trusted signers. In this context,
establishing a given signer as trusted means adding
that signer\[aq]s certificate to
\fIstaprun\fR\[aq]s
database of trusted signers.

.PP
The
.I stap\-authorize\-signing\-cert
program adds the given signing certificate to the given
certificate database, making that signer a trusted server for
\fIstaprun\fR when using
that database.

.SH ARGUMENTS
The
.I stap\-authorize\-signing\-cert
program accepts two arguments:

.TP
.B CERTFILE
This is the name of the file containing the certificate of the new trusted
signer. 
For systemtap compile servers, this is the file named \fIstap.cert\fR which
can be found in the
server\[aq]s certificate database.
On the server host,
for servers started by the \fIstap\-server\fR service, this database can be
found in \fI/var/lib/stap\-server/.systemtap/ssl/server/\fR.
For servers run by other non\-root users,
this database can be found in
.I $HOME/.systemtap/ssl/server/\fP.
For root users (EUID=0), it can be found in
.I @sysconfdir@/systemtap/ssl/server\fP.

.TP
.B DIRNAME
This optional argument is the name of the directory containing the
certificate database to which the certificate is to be added. If not specified,
the
default is
.I @sysconfdir@/systemtap/staprun/\fP.
That is, the default result
is that all users on the local host will trust this signer. Note that this
default directory is only writable by root.

.SH SAFETY AND SECURITY
Systemtap is an administrative tool.  It exposes kernel internal data
structures and potentially private user information.  See the 
.IR stap (1)
manual page for additional information on safety and security.

.PP
\fISystemtap\fR uses Network Security Services (NSS)
for module signing and verification. The NSS tool
.I certutil
is used for the generation of certificates. The related
certificate databases must be protected in order to maintain the security of
the system.
Use of the utilities provided will help to ensure that the proper protection
is maintained. \fIstaprun\fR will check for proper
access permissions before making use of any certificate database.

.SH FILES
.TP
@sysconfdir@/systemtap/staprun/
\fIstaprun\fR\[aq]s trusted signer certificate database.

.TP
/var/lib/stap\-server/.systemtap/ssl/server/stap.cert
Signing certificate for servers started by the \fIstap\-server\fR service.
